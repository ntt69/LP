# Digital Services Act (DSA): A Comprehensive Guide

In the constantly evolving digital landscape, the need for regulations to maintain user safety, protect fundamental rights, and promote fair competition is paramount. Recognizing these needs, the European Commission proposed the Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act or DSA) on December 15, 2020.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the DSA, its aims, and the obligations it places on different types of service providers.

## Understanding the DSA

The DSA is a significant step towards ensuring that digital services, particularly online platforms like social media and marketplaces, operate in a manner that is beneficial to users, service providers, and society as a whole. The proposed regulation aims to address the challenges and risks posed by the modern digital services landscape while fostering an environment conducive to the growth and innovation of digital services within the internal market.

The DSA outlines clear responsibilities and accountability for providers of digital services, particularly online platforms. It seeks to introduce due diligence obligations, including notice-and-action procedures for illegal content and mechanisms for users to challenge content moderation decisions. The goal is to improve online safety across the EU and bolster the protection of fundamental rights.

For large online platforms that have a significant impact on the economy and society, the DSA proposes stricter standards of transparency and accountability. This includes requirements for content moderation, advertising, and the use of algorithmic processes. Platforms are expected to assess the risks posed by their systems and develop suitable risk management tools.

One of the crucial aspects of the DSA is its focus on maintaining the liability rules for intermediary services providers set out in the e-Commerce Directive. The aim is to provide legal certainty, encourage voluntary investigations by providers to ensure user safety, and clarify their role from a consumer perspective.
